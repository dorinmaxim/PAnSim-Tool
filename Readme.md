PAnSim Tool by Dorin Maxim
-----------------------------


PAnSim is a Probabilistic Analysis and Simulation Tool meant to simulate and analyze real-tiem task-sets whih have their parameters (i.e. WCET and periods) given as (probability) distributions.

The supported schedulign policy is FPPS (fixed priority preemptive scheduling).
Inputs are textual (task-set parameters) and outputs are numerical (listes of response times observed during simulation, probabilisti response time distributions in the form of random variables, etc) as well as graphical (gant chart of the runtime scheduling, plot of analytical/empirical exceedente distribution functions, etc).

PAnSim is implemented in Matlab by Dorin Maxim. Copyright is held by Dorin Maxim. 
PSnSim is free for academic use provided that its use is aknowledged and credit is given (e.g. referenced in publications).
